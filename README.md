# Raspberry Pi Zero Camera Cardboard Project
The templates in this repo is based on the camera module sold in here: http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/mr.craig-lewis/m.html

### Background
This project was inspired by the google cardboard VR (recently it released AIY...also cardboard). As the raspberry pi camera player, I made this for my own projects. This weekend my friend visited me and saw my cardboard camera kit, he said I should open source it, so here it is.
